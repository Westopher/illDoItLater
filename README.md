# illDoItLater

This is a To Do list app where users will be able to select an option to send themselves an email reminding them to do a task later,
hence the name "I'll do it later."

At the moment the user can add and remove data. I am currently working on allowing the user to persist data on their local device.

A stretch goal I have for this project is to allow the use to set a time that the email will be sent to them.
